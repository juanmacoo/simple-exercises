# Give me the odd ones

I have a credit card number with 4 separate 4 character values e.g. `abc4-3322-fg45-55nn` and I want to get all values that are not a number or a hyphen `-`. Write a function called `getOddOnes` that receives the full credit card number and outputs all the letter separate by space.

## Example

```js
card = "abc4-3322-fg45-55nn"
console.log(getOddOnes(card)) #output is "a b c f g n n"
```
