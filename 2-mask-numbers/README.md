# Mask numbers

I have a credit card number with 4 separate 4 character values e.g. `abc4-3322-fg45-55nn` and I want to mask all numbers with an # i.e. `abc#-####-fg##-##nn`. Write a function called `maskNumbers` that receives the full credit card number and outputs the same card but replaces all numbers with `#`.

## Example

```js
card = "abc4-3322-fg45-55nn"
console.log(maskNumbers(card)) #output is 55nn
```
