# How many numbers

I have a credit card number with 4 separate 4 character values e.g. `abc4-3322-fg45-55nn` and I want to know how many numbers ar in the card. Write a function called `countNumbers` that receives the full credit card number and outputs the amount of numbers in the card.

## Example

```js
card = "abc4-3322-fg45-55nn"
console.log(countNumbers(card)) #output is 9
```
