# Only last 4

I have a credit card number with 4 separate 4 character values e.g. `abc4-3322-fg45-55nn` and I want to know only the last 4 i.e. `55nn`. Write a function called `lastFour` that receives the full credit card number and outputs the last 4 values.

## Example

```js
card = "abc4-3322-fg45-55nn"
console.log(lsatFour(card)) #output is 55nn
```
